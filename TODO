- test RHGB frontend
- think about text frontend
- make ModuleSet work
- add code for loading other interfaces (?)
- be able to log to files, etc.
- still need to write out the /etc/sysconfig/firstboot file
- test to make sure busted modules are still skipped
- fix adding a ModuleSet to the history
