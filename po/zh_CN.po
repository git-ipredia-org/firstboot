#. Let's check to see if firstboot should be run or not
#. If we're in debug mode, run anyway.  Even if the file exists
#. Well first, is this even being run as root?
#. We're not in debug mode, so do some checking
#. First, look and see if /etc/sysconfig/firstboot exists
#. If /etc/sysconfig/firstboot exists, parse the file
#. If we find 'RUN_FIRSTBOOT=NO' in the file, then don't run firstboot
#. Firstboot should not be run
#. Firstboot has never been run before, so start it up
#. Let's check to see if we're in runlevel 5.  If we're in runlevel 3, let's call
#. textWindow for the TUI
#. Keep running the program until either the timer has expired or the user pressed Exit
#. They're done with firstboot.  Exit for good
#. If rhgb (graphical boot) is running, let's use it's X server
#. However, we still need to start up metacity and merge the X resources
#. If there's no X Server running, let's start one
#. set the display environment variable
#. # firstbootWindow.py - the main firstboot UI and framework.py
